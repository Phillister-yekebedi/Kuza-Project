                   We understand that the worlds of art, culture, and <br>
                   creativity are more than just expressions of human <br>
                   magination. They serve as powerful tools for those <br>
                   on the fringes of society to shape laws, influence <br>
                   public policies, reshape politics, and challenge  <br>
                   prevailing perceptions. Through their distinct viewpoints, <br>
                   they can seize control, secure representation, and usher <br>
                   in tangible political change.
